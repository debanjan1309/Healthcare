# _Revolutionizing Healthcare with Machine Learning_

_we've created a predictive model to predict:-_
1) The possible disease of a patient using top 5 symptoms given by the patient. For a predicted disease, a specialised doctor will also be suggested to the patient. And the contact link will also be given to the patient attached with it.
 
2) Patient can also check the possible symptoms for a specific disease.
 
3) Anyone with an urgent need of blood can check for the specific blood group availability at his nearest bloodbanks. The bloodbank officials can update the entry in daily basis in the specific database of the bloodbank.
